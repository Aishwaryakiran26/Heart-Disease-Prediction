#  Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the presence of heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.  
It demonstrates a complete workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and feature analysis.

## Workflow
1. *Data Preprocessing:*
   Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and binarized the target variable num.
   
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*
   Visualized class distribution, correlation heatmap, and identified top predictive features.
   
3. *Model Training & Evaluation:*
   Trained multiple models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   Evaluated the models using accuracy, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
   
4. *Feature Analysis:*
   Identified top features impacting heart disease prediction like the exercise-induced angina, chest pain type, maximum heart rate, ST depression, sex.
   
5. *Results:*
   SVM was the best-performing model with 85% accuracy.
